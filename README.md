# image-retrieval-system
Content based image retrieval system used for my undergraduate thesis in computer vision at [UNSW](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/computer-science-engineering/). This tool was used to assess the effectiveness of image features for image retrieval.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
1. git clone

2. Create virtual environment

3. pip install requirements
```

### Usage

```
1. Train a model

2. Put config into feature_params.json to create index

3. Put config into search_params.json to evaluate image retrieval performance

4. python main.py
```
